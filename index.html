    <h1>Personal Branding Assignment</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my portfolio. Below you can find my personal branding assignment with both the script and the audio recording available for download, as well as an article sharing my journey through personal growth and snooker.</p>

    <h2>Article: Beyond the Table: A Journey</h2>

    <h3>My name is Darrel Chiang Jin Rui</h3>
    <p>
      Coming from a small town, Sungai Petani in Kedah, and at 19 years old, my dreams always seemed confined within the boundaries of familiarization. Yet, even at the heart of a town where life moves slower than one would normally perceive, the spark within one's ambition can kindle into a remarkable journey. That spark for me was snooker—a game seemingly so simple, yet it encapsulated an entire universe within itself. It wasn't about winning or losing; snooker, since that very moment I came across the sport, became a mirror reflecting not just who I was but who I could become.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything started when, as a small child, I stood on tiptoes in the living room of my house, mesmerized by a match broadcast on TV. At the time, I didn't exactly understand the game, but there was something in the quiet concentration of the players, in the rhythmic click of the balls, in the silent precision of the game. It wasn't loud or flashy like other sports I'd seen. Snooker was elegant, disciplined—a silent dance of strategy and skill. I wanted to belong in that world, not as an outsider, but as a participant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fascination grew when I finally persuaded my father to take me to the local snooker hall. It was small, dimly lit, and tucked away in a part of town few people visited. But when I entered that room, it felt almost sacred. The air smelled of chalk dust, the felt tables glittered under the soft lights, and the quiet hum of concentrated players enveloped me. It was a world all its own, where time slowed down and nothing mattered but the cue, the balls, and the table. I was home.
    </p>

    <h3>The Love That Grows</h3>
    <p>
      From that first visit, I was hooked. I pleaded with my dad to take me back, and soon after, I started practicing seriously. But like all great loves, snooker wasn’t without its struggles. Alone, it was initially me, the cue, and a mountain of frustration. My hands were unsure, my movements stiff; every shot I set up seemed destined to miss. It was as if the game itself was rejecting me—as if snooker was a club I wasn’t yet worthy to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      With each missed shot, my confidence chipped away, and the voice of self-doubt grew louder. Why continue when nothing was going right? Most would have quit. But my reason to return wasn’t superficial; it was something deeper. It wasn’t just about the game—it was a test of will, discipline, and the quest for mastery. I realized I didn’t love snooker because I was naturally good at it; I loved it because it demanded more of me than I had ever given before.
    </p>
    <p>
      What intrigued me wasn’t just potting the balls, but the deeper lessons snooker had to offer. This game teaches patience. You can’t rush your shot, and you can’t force the balls to behave as you wish. You must read the table, think three moves ahead, and, most importantly, stay calm. A shot is a decision—a slice of clarity in the midst of uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h3>From Struggles to Self-Belief</h3>
    <p>
      As time went on, my relationship with snooker changed. It had long ceased to be just a hobby. It had become a journey—a personal crusade to better myself. Every hour spent practicing and every game I played became a reflection of my life’s journey. Each defeat, no matter how painful, was a lesson waiting to be learned. Instead of being defeated by losses, I began to embrace them. Every missed shot and botched break was a piece of the puzzle I needed to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, each loss felt like a personal failure. I’d stand there, cue in hand, watching my opponent clear the table, silently fuming, wondering where I went wrong. It was hard not to let those defeats erode my confidence. But eventually, I realized something important: it wasn’t about how many times I failed—it was about how many times I got back up and tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time I walked away from the table after a loss, I did so with a new understanding of my weaknesses. I began to analyze my games critically, studying every angle, every mistake. I broke down my technique and focused on improving my cue action, while also building my mental resilience. Snooker isn’t just a physical test—it’s a mental one. It’s easy to let frustration cloud your judgment or let one bad shot ruin an entire game. But to master snooker, I had to master my mind. Focus, patience, and the ability to stay composed under pressure became my greatest strengths.
    </p>

    <h3>Battle for the Championship</h3>
    <p>
      The day of the championship finally arrived—the culmination of years of hard work. I wasn’t just competing against the other players; I was battling every version of myself that had ever doubted me. But this time, I was ready. The jitters that had plagued me in past competitions were nowhere to be found. I felt calm, almost serene, as I stepped into the arena. This wasn’t just a competition—it was the embodiment of everything I had been working towards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match itself was brutal. My opponents were among the best I had ever faced—players who had pushed themselves just as hard as I had. But this time, I wasn’t just another competitor; I was battle-hardened. Every shot I took, every decision I made, drew on years of preparation. I wasn’t playing to avoid losing; I was playing to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the final ball dropped into the pocket, a wave of peace washed over me. The clapping around me faded into the background as I stood there, trophy in hand, realizing I had done it. But the real victory wasn’t in the trophy—it was in the knowledge that I had gained something far more valuable: the ability to bounce back from failure and keep pushing forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Beyond Victory</h3>
    <p>
      Standing there, holding the trophy, I realized that this moment—this victory—wasn’t the end of my journey, but just another milestone. Snooker had given me so much more than a title. It had given me purpose. The game was never about winning a trophy—it was about proving to myself that with passion, persistence, and belief in oneself, anything is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I want to spread that message to others. My story isn’t just about becoming a snooker champion; it’s about resilience, embracing failure, and understanding that success isn’t measured by the accolades you collect, but by the journey itself. My journey continues, and I eagerly await whatever lies ahead.
